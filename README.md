# üêâ HERE BE DRAGONS üêâ

This version of Val is currently an alpha version - the API can be considered relatively stable, but expect some features to be broken and the UX to be changing.

## Table of contents

- [Introduction](#content-as-code)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Documentation](#documentation)

## Content as code

Val is a CMS library where **content** is **TypeScript** / **JavaScript** files stored in your git repo.

As a CMS, Val is useful because:

- editors can **change content** without having to ask developers to do it for them (and nobody wants that)
- a **well-documented** way to **structure content**
- **image**, **richtext**, ... support is built-in
- built-in **visual editing** which lets editors click-then-edit content (and therefore **code**!) directly in your app
  ![Visual editing](https://val.build/docs/images/visual-editing.png)
- an embedded studio which lets editors navigate the content structure and make updates there
  ![Studio](https://val.build/docs/images/studio.png)

<details>
<summary>Definition: editor</summary>
An editor in this context, is a non-technical person that edits content in your application (technical writer, proof-reader, legal, ...).
</details>

<br />

But, with the benefits of **hard-coded** content:

- works seamlessly **locally** or with git **branches**
- content is **type-checked** so you can spend less time on figuring out why something isn't working
  ![Type check error](https://val.build/docs/images/type-check-error.png)
- content can be refactored (change names, etc) just as if it was hard-coded (because it is)
  ![Renaming](https://val.build/docs/images/renaming.gif)
- works as normal with your **favorite IDE** without any plugins: search for content, references to usages, ...
  ![References](https://val.build/docs/images/references.gif)
- **no** need for **code-gen** and extra build steps
- **fast** since the content is literally hosted with the application
- content is **always there** and can never fail (since it is not loaded from somewhere)
- no need to manage different **environments** containing different versions of content
- **resolve conflicts** like you normally resolve conflicts **in git**

Compared to other CMSs, Val has the following advantages:

- **easy** to setup and to _grok_: Val is designed to have a minimum of boilerplate and there's **0** query languages to learn. If you know your way around JSON that's enough (and if you don't you know JSON, you might want to learn that first)
- **no signup** required to use it locally
- **no fees** for content that is in your code: your content is your code, and your code is... yours
- **minimal** API surface: Val is designed to not "infect" your code base
- **easy to remove**: since your content is already in your code and Val is designed to have a minimal surface, it's easy to remove if you want to switch
- eslint rules and [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valbuild.vscode-val-build) for an even **better-than-hard-coded** developer experience

<details>
<summary>Upcoming feature: <strong>i18n</strong></summary>
Val will soon have support for i18n. Follow this repository to get notified when this is the case.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Upcoming feature: <strong>remote content</strong></summary>
Having hard-coded content is great for landing pages, product pages and other pages where the amount of content is manageable.

However, checking in the 10 000th blog entry in git might feel wrong (though we would say it is ok).

Therefore, Val will add `remote content` support which enables you to seamlessly move content to the cloud and back again as desired.
You code will still be the one truth, but the actual content will be hosted on [val.build](https://val.build).

`.remote()` support will also make it possible to have remote images to avoid having to put them in your repository.

There will also be specific support for remote i18n, which will make it possible to split which languages are defined in code, and which are fetched from remote.

More details on `.remote()` will follow later.

</details>

## When to NOT use Val

Val is designed to work well on a single web-app, and currently only supports Next 13.4+ (more meta-frameworks will supported) and GitHub (more Git providers will follow).

Unless your application fits these requirements, you should have a look elsewhere (at least for now).

In addition, if you have a "content model", i.e. content schemas, that rarely change and you plan on using them in a lot of different applications (web, mobile, etc), Val will most likely not be a great fit.

If that is the case, we recommend having a look at [Sanity](https://sanity.io) instead (we have no affiliation, but if we didn't have Val we would use Sanity).

**NOTE**: Our experience is that, however nice it sounds, it is hard to "nail" the content model down. Usually content (on, for example, your landing page) is derived from what you want to present, not vice-versa. In addition, you should think carefully whether you _really_ want to present the exact same content on all these different surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Upcoming feature: <strong>external content</strong></summary>
Val will support external content, i.e. content from other Val projects, CMSs or DBs some time in the future.
</details>

## Examples

Examples can found [here](./examples).

## Documentation

Val currently only support Next.js.

To get started using Next.js, checkout the [README](./packages/next/README.md).

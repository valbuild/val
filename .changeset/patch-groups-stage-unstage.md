Add staging and unstaging of pending changes, so one person can publish a small fix without shipping somebody else's unfinished work.

A **patch group** is the set of patches one user has chosen to publish. It is not a patch _set_: a patch set is computed from the schema and says which patches must move together, while a patch group is curated and says which ones you want live.

A group holds its owner's own work plus whatever the closure entangled with it — not everything pending. **So Publish changes meaning on a shared branch: it ships your changes and what they depend on, instead of everything anybody has pending.** That is the feature. Unstaging goes further: hold one of your own changes back and it leaves both your preview and your publish, while still existing for everyone else.

The rule relating the two is that for every group and every patch set, the group's members within that patch set must form a prefix in patch-chain order. Staging a change therefore pulls in whatever preceded it in the same patch set; unstaging drops whatever was built on top of it. The compare view names what a toggle moves, and whose it is, rather than quietly enlarging or shrinking a publish.

Editing inside a region you are holding back is allowed, and the patches you were holding are loaded back in rather than the edit being refused. An earlier design made such a region read-only until it was staged again, because an author picks an array index while looking at their own view — so re-staging patches afterwards can shift the content under the path they just chose, and their edit lands on the wrong element cleanly, with every invariant intact and only the content wrong. That guard is not what ships. It is a rare shape in practice, since two people's edits mostly land in different routes, and refusing an edit for a reason the author cannot see is a worse everyday experience than the case it prevents. Instead the real result is shown immediately: the widened set is what the editor renders and what the compare view lists.

Also fixes a pre-existing bug in patch set grouping: patch set paths were compared with a raw string prefix test, and nothing terminates a path segment, so `?foobar/title` matched `?foo`. Deleting record key `foo` and retitling record key `foobar` were treated as one inseparable change. Previously that over-grouped two unrelated edits in the review screen; with staging it would have meant publishing a deletion nobody asked for.

The `/patches` routes gain optional patch group fields and `/patch-groups/~/patches` is new. This needs a content API that has patch groups. Filesystem mode keeps the group in the client, since it has a single author and already sends an explicit patch id list when publishing.

When a save pulls other people's changes in, you are told: a toast names how many and whose. There is no undo, because your edit was written against the view those changes produce and now depends on them — the compare view shows the widened set.

Two other things keep a session honest about a shared branch. `/stat` now says which pending changes have already been published, so another author's publish stops looking pending in your Studio the moment it lands rather than when the site redeploys. And Publish refuses, without writing anything, if somebody published while you were reviewing — the review screen you acted on described a branch that has since moved.

Two things this does **not** do yet, both of which need the group annotation to refresh on its own rather than only inside a fetch for missing patch ids:

- a stage or unstage in one tab does not reach another tab;
- if persisting a stage fails, the local view keeps it until the page is reloaded.

`docs/independent-publish/DESIGN.md` describes the model and lists what is still a judgement call.

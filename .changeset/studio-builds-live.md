The Studio works again when served from the published package, and a managed project's publish now puts the saved edit on the site.

- **The Studio did not start in 0.136.0.** Its main bundle imports sibling chunks by relative path, and the Studio is served at `/api/val/static/<version>/app`, so those imports resolved to paths the handler did not know and came back as the HTML fallback — which a browser refuses as a module script. Preview was gone with it. The handler now serves those chunks, and the package build follows every import the bundle makes before it lets a release through.
- **The in-browser builder could not load.** The Studio's bundle carried rolldown's Node WASI binding, which throws `process is not defined` in a tab. It now uses the browser binding, and the build refuses a bundle that contains the Node one.
- **A managed publish builds what was just saved.** `/save` returns the source files the commit wrote, the Studio builds with them laid over the project's stored source, and publishes that source back with the build — so the next edit starts from this one rather than undoing it. The save's commit is also passed through to the build, which previously ran as though no commit had been made.
- **The bundler's WebAssembly is served from `content.val.build/v1/static`** (`DEFAULT_STATIC_HOST`), still addressed by its SHA-256. `globalThis.__VAL_ROLLDOWN_WASM_URL__` still overrides it.
- The `val.server.ts` that `@valbuild/tanstack-build` generates no longer hands a save's files to the platform (`platform.internal/__api/source`). A managed project's Studio builds in its own tab, and the platform has closed that door. `isWired` recognises files wired either way.
- `@valbuild/tanstack-build/constants` exports the contract paths and the artifact key namespace from an entrypoint that imports nothing else, for callers that must not load the bundler. The namespace gains a `source` key.

### Patch Changes

- [#652](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/652) [`f2fe70d`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/f2fe70dab2b65000dfaf289f09c70b4a8291467a) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - `s.union` is now `s.discriminatedUnion` and `s.enum`.

  `s.union` did two unrelated jobs and worked out which one you meant from its
  first argument: a string key meant a tagged union of objects, literal schemas
  meant a set of allowed strings. Those are now two schemas with two names.

  ```ts
  // A fixed set of strings — presents as a dropdown
  s.enum("primary", "secondary", "ghost"); // Schema<"primary" | "secondary" | "ghost">

  // One of several object shapes, told apart by a tag field
  s.discriminatedUnion(
    "type",
    s.object({ type: s.literal("hero"), heading: s.string() }),
    s.object({ type: s.literal("quote"), text: s.string() }),
  );
  ```

  `s.enum` takes the strings directly, so the `s.literal(...)` wrapper is gone.

  **`s.union` still works** — it is deprecated, and it builds exactly the schema
  above, so nothing has to change today:

  ```ts
  s.union(s.literal("one"), s.literal("two")); // → s.enum("one", "two")
  s.union("type", pageA, pageB); // → s.discriminatedUnion("type", pageA, pageB)
  ```

  The two are different kinds of node, and that is the reason for the split. A
  discriminated union is a container: the selected variant's fields are the fields
  being edited, and everything that walks a schema descends through it. An enum is
  a leaf — a string with a closed domain — so nothing recurses into it. Told apart
  only by the shape of `key`, every consumer had to re-derive which one it was
  holding; each now has its own serialized type (`"discriminated-union"` and
  `"enum"`) and Val Studio has a field per kind rather than one field that
  branches.

  Two behaviour changes fall out of the split, both of them fixes:

  - A value that is not a string at all now fails an enum's validation with a
    type error. `s.union` of literals only ever checked the value against its
    literals when the value WAS a string, so a number or an object where an enum
    was declared validated clean.
  - An enum field now shows its validation errors in Val Studio where the field
    is opened on its own — the module editor and the canvas's fields column — and
    gets the compact error layout inside an inline list row. It is a leaf now, so
    it goes through the same error rendering as every other leaf field; the string
    union bypassed it and showed nothing in those places.

  Several latent crashes in the old `s.union` are fixed on the way past, all of
  them cases where it threw a `TypeError` instead of reporting:

  - A required discriminated union holding `null` now reports a type error rather
    than throwing, and resolving a path underneath a nullable one that is `null`
    gives the error the API promises instead of a crash.
  - `s.literal("")` is a legal discriminator tag, and `s.enum("")` a legal value.
    Both used to be treated as absent by a truthiness check — in path resolution,
    in stega encoding, and in the message that lists a union's valid tags. The
    editor's dropdowns handle them too: an empty value is reserved by the select
    component and had to be mapped around.
  - A variant that omits the discriminator entirely is now reported as the schema
    error it is, instead of throwing while the check looked for it.
  - An enum's value is now indexed for search, like every other string leaf. The
    old string union was never indexed at all, so searching for one of its values
    could not find the field.
  - A nullable discriminated union set to `null` no longer renders a spinner that
    never resolves.

  `s.discriminatedUnion` also requires at least one variant, as `s.enum` requires
  at least one value: a union with nothing to select is not a thing to write, and
  everything downstream reads the first variant where it needs any.

  If you read serialized schemas yourself, that is the breaking part: `type` is no
  longer `"union"`, an enum carries `values: string[]` instead of a `key` plus
  `items` of literal schemas, and `UnionSchema` is no longer a class.
  `SerializedUnionSchema`, `SerializedStringUnionSchema`,
  `SerializedObjectUnionSchema` and `UnionSchema` remain as deprecated type
  aliases.

- [#661](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/661) [`171208a`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/171208a20177e68ed5a8b1a6fdaabfe893a6aa5f) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Every schema method now has a worked `@example` in its JSDoc, so hovering it in
  your editor shows what to write.

  That covers the whole builder surface — `.describe()`, `.validate()`,
  `.nullable()`, `.readonly()`, `.hidden()`, `.preview()`, `.render()`, and the
  per-type methods such as `.minLength()`, `.regexp()`, `.raw()`, `.multiline()`,
  `.from()` / `.to()`, `.remote()`, `.jsonValues()` and `.external()` — as well as
  `c.define()`, `c.json()`, `c.external()` and the `val` helpers (`val.attrs`,
  `val.raw`, `val.unstable_getPath` and friends).

  One of the examples corrected a real trap: a custom validator returns
  `false | string`, so the natural-looking

  ```ts
  s.string().validate((val) => val.trim() === val || "No surrounding spaces");
  ```

  does not type check — `||` yields `true`, and `true` is not one of the two
  answers. Write it as a ternary instead:

  ```ts
  s.string().validate((val) =>
    val.trim() === val ? false : "No surrounding spaces",
  );
  ```

  The examples are checked in CI, not just written: one test asks the TypeScript
  checker for the doc each method actually resolves to and fails if it has no
  `@example`, and another compiles every example it finds.

### Minor Changes

- [#638](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/638) [`c390397`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/c390397cb5e203eb1bedae3a6fab15726e850b90) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Val now runs on TanStack Start.

  `@valbuild/tanstack` is a new package with everything `@valbuild/next` has: Val
  Studio at `/val`, the on-page overlay and canvas, draft mode, the client hooks,
  server-side content reads, images, and the MCP tools.

  ```sh
  npm install @valbuild/tanstack
  ```

  ```ts
  // val.config.ts
  import { initVal } from "@valbuild/tanstack";
  const { s, c, config, tanstackRouter } = initVal({ project: "org/project" });
  ```

  **Routes are first class.** A Val module for a route is named after the route
  file it sits beside — `src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx` is served content by
  `src/routes/posts.$postId.val.ts` — and its keys are the URLs that route serves:

  ```ts
  export default c.define(
    "/src/routes/posts.$postId.val.ts",
    s.router(tanstackRouter, s.object({ title: s.string() })),
    { "/posts/hello-world": { title: "Hello world" } },
  );
  ```

  `.` and `/` both separate segments, `$param` is a parameter, `$` is a splat, and
  `index`, `route`, `(groups)` and `_pathless` layouts add no URL segment — the
  same rules TanStack Router uses for the route file itself. Val validates every
  key against that pattern, and Val Studio shows these modules as a sitemap under
  **Pages**, where an editor can add a page.

  Point the route generator away from your content files, in `vite.config.ts` and
  `tsr.config.json`:

  ```ts
  tanstackStart({ router: { routeFileIgnorePattern: "\\.val\\.[tj]sx?$" } });
  ```

  See the [README](https://github.com/valbuild/val/blob/main/packages/tanstack/README.md)
  for the full wiring, and `examples/tanstack` for a working app.

  **Also fixed, for everyone:** `Internal.VERSION.core` was `null` in any ESM
  bundle — it was read with `require("../package.json")` inside a `try`, so the
  failure was silent. That version goes into every remote file ref and proxy mode
  refuses to start without it. Every package now reads its version through a
  static JSON import, which is inlined at build time.

  Two smaller fixes that came out of running the whole toolchain against a
  TanStack project:

  - `val versions` reports `@valbuild/tanstack`, and `val debug` writes a snapshot
    that names whichever framework package the captured project actually has.
  - `@valbuild/eslint-plugin` reads a `tsconfig.json` that has comments in it. A
    tsconfig is JSONC, and `JSON.parse` is not — so on any project whose tsconfig
    carries a comment (the TanStack starter's does) the
    `module-in-val-modules` rule threw `Expected double-quoted property name in
JSON` on the first file and took the whole lint run with it.

  Three fixes found by driving the Studio against a real TanStack app:

  - **A draft image now loads on the page.** The source the Studio pushes to the
    host page carries `patch_id` for any file whose bytes are still in a patch, so
    the page asks `/api/val/files/...?patch_id=` rather than a `/public` path that
    nothing has written yet. This was silent — the image just did not appear — and
    it affects any page that reads media through the hooks rather than on the
    server, `@valbuild/next` included.
  - **A splat route no longer logs an error on every render.** TanStack returns
    both `_splat` and `*` for the same parameter; Val reported the second as a
    parameter it could not place in the path.
  - The TanStack example and starter render a 404 page instead of throwing
    `notFound()` from a component, which escaped to the error boundary and logged
    `Error in renderToReadableStream` (and, with no not-found component
    configured, aborted the response) on every miss.

### Minor Changes

- [#464](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/464) [`2bcc6fd`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/2bcc6fdff8d668123e07e3c5e81ac6fa1436e47b) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Add staging and unstaging of pending changes, so one person can publish a small fix without shipping somebody else's unfinished work.

  A **patch group** is the set of patches one user has chosen to publish. It is not a patch _set_: a patch set is computed from the schema and says which patches must move together, while a patch group is curated and says which ones you want live.

  A group holds its owner's own work plus whatever the closure entangled with it — not everything pending. **So Publish changes meaning on a shared branch: it ships your changes and what they depend on, instead of everything anybody has pending.** That is the feature. Unstaging goes further: hold one of your own changes back and it leaves both your preview and your publish, while still existing for everyone else.

  The rule relating the two is that for every group and every patch set, the group's members within that patch set must form a prefix in patch-chain order. Staging a change therefore pulls in whatever preceded it in the same patch set; unstaging drops whatever was built on top of it. The compare view names what a toggle moves, and whose it is, rather than quietly enlarging or shrinking a publish.

  Editing inside a region you are holding back is allowed, and the patches you were holding are loaded back in rather than the edit being refused. An earlier design made such a region read-only until it was staged again, because an author picks an array index while looking at their own view — so re-staging patches afterwards can shift the content under the path they just chose, and their edit lands on the wrong element cleanly, with every invariant intact and only the content wrong. That guard is not what ships. It is a rare shape in practice, since two people's edits mostly land in different routes, and refusing an edit for a reason the author cannot see is a worse everyday experience than the case it prevents. Instead the real result is shown immediately: the widened set is what the editor renders and what the compare view lists.

  Also fixes a pre-existing bug in patch set grouping: patch set paths were compared with a raw string prefix test, and nothing terminates a path segment, so `?foobar/title` matched `?foo`. Deleting record key `foo` and retitling record key `foobar` were treated as one inseparable change. Previously that over-grouped two unrelated edits in the review screen; with staging it would have meant publishing a deletion nobody asked for.

  The `/patches` routes gain optional patch group fields and `/patch-groups/~/patches` is new. This needs a content API that has patch groups. Filesystem mode keeps the group in the client, since it has a single author and already sends an explicit patch id list when publishing.

  When a save pulls other people's changes in, you are told: a toast names how many and whose. There is no undo, because your edit was written against the view those changes produce and now depends on them — the compare view shows the widened set.

  Two other things keep a session honest about a shared branch. `/stat` now says which pending changes have already been published, so another author's publish stops looking pending in your Studio the moment it lands rather than when the site redeploys. And Publish refuses, without writing anything, if somebody published while you were reviewing — the review screen you acted on described a branch that has since moved.

  Two things this does **not** do yet, both of which need the group annotation to refresh on its own rather than only inside a fetch for missing patch ids:

  - a stage or unstage in one tab does not reach another tab;
  - if persisting a stage fails, the local view keeps it until the page is reloaded.

  `docs/independent-publish/DESIGN.md` describes the model and lists what is still a judgement call.

- [#605](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/605) [`6794d29`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/6794d2980bc81284ab7f2cc667f01cc21c9e3a79) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - `s.settings()`: the project's settings, as content.

  A settings module is one per project, at the root of the content tree:

  ```typescript
  // settings.val.ts
  export default c.define("/settings.val.ts", s.settings(), {});
  ```

  Register it in `val.modules.ts` like any other module, and it shows up in the
  Studio under the cog at the foot of the left rail. Everything in it is content:
  it is edited as a draft, it appears in the publish diff, and it is the same for
  everyone working on the project.

  Every key is optional, at every level, so `{}` is a complete settings module —
  and stays one as sections are added. What it holds today is the assistant:

  ```typescript
  export default c.define("/settings.val.ts", s.settings(), {
    assistant: {
      enabled: true,
      context: "A CMS for developers, run by a team of four in Oslo.",
      tone: "Plain and direct. British English, sentence case in headings.",
    },
  });
  ```

  `context` is background the assistant would otherwise guess at; `tone` is how it
  should write when it writes content. Both are sent with every message it makes.

  `enabled` decides whether editors have an assistant, and it has **three** states
  rather than two:

  - `true` — they do.
  - `false` — they do not, and every trace of it goes: no button in the top bar,
    no row in the quick actions, no panel, nothing sent.
  - unset — nobody has decided. The assistant is still **shown**, and asks to be
    turned on before it is used. Hiding an assistant nobody has decided about
    means nobody discovers it; quietly enabling one means a project starts sending
    its content to a model because it did not know to say no.

  A project with no settings module at all has an assistant, as before: there is
  nowhere to record a decision, and nowhere for the prompt to write the answer.

  **Breaking: `ai.chat` is gone from `val.config.ts`.** Whether the assistant is
  available is a decision about the project's content, made by the people who edit
  it, so it moved to settings — turning the chat on used to take a developer, a
  deploy and a code review of a boolean. Remove the whole block:

  ```diff
   const { s, c, val, config } = initVal({
  -  ai: {
  -    chat: {
  -      experimental: { enable: true },
  -      suggestions: ["Summarize", "Fix typos at this page"],
  -      title: "Ask me anything",
  -      description: "Val can answer questions about the content.",
  -    },
  -  },
   });
  ```

  `experimental.enable` becomes `assistant.enabled` in the settings module.
  `suggestions`, `title` and `description` are removed with nothing replacing
  them: the assistant now opens with its own copy. A project that had the chat
  enabled and wants it to stay on for everyone should write
  `assistant: { enabled: true }` — otherwise editors are offered it and asked.

  `ai.commitMessages` stays in `val.config.ts`, and is unaffected.

  Two settings modules, or one in a subdirectory, is a module error: the dev
  server refuses to serve sources, `npx val validate` reports it against the file,
  and the Studio says so rather than picking one.

### Minor Changes

- [#589](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/589) [`c2d3c0e`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/c2d3c0e6c2010c0a94c725d9dbaa618998773e8a) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - **Breaking:** `s.richtext()` options are flat.

  The `style`, `block` and `inline` groups are gone — every option is a key of its
  own. The names are unchanged, so updating a schema is only a matter of removing
  the wrappers:

  ```ts
  // before
  s.richtext({
    style: { bold: true, italic: true },
    block: { h1: true, ul: true },
    inline: { a: true, img: s.image() },
  });

  // after
  s.richtext({
    bold: true,
    italic: true,
    h1: true,
    ul: true,
    a: true,
    img: s.image(),
  });
  ```

  The groups never carried any meaning the option names did not already have, and
  they cost something real: an option name and its `ValRichText` theme key were
  spelled differently (`block.h1` vs `theme.h1`), so the type that keeps a theme
  exhaustive had to restate all thirteen options by hand. It is now a mapped type
  over the options themselves — which also fixes an inconsistency in it: enabling
  links with a schema (`a: s.route()`) rather than `a: true` now requires an `a`
  key in the theme, the way `img` always has.

  `ValRichText` themes were already flat and are unchanged. The serialized schema
  that the server sends the Studio is flat too, so a project must not mix
  `@valbuild/*` versions across this release.

### Minor Changes

- [#574](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/574) [`198ba8b`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/198ba8bd8e6c921660e97f5cd26fb17f2d5f3f95) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - The assistant lets you pick which model answers, from the models your key can
  actually reach.

  The content server now asks each provider what a key may use and reports the
  answer; the Studio offers exactly that, beside the composer. Which model to use
  is a per-message decision — something cheap for a typo, something strong for a
  hard question — so the control sits where the message is written rather than in
  a settings panel.

  The choice is remembered per browser and re-checked against what is on offer
  each time the assistant starts, so a model an account has lost access to is
  quietly replaced instead of being sent and refused.

  A content server that does not report models, or could not reach a provider,
  leaves the built-in catalog as the fallback, filtered to reachable providers.

### Patch Changes

- [#579](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/579) [`b2812ae`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/b2812ae4ee03e005ecead3365f49c625e536f94d) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Every release now ships a changelog. Each package's `CHANGELOG.md` records what
  changed under the version that shipped it — with a link to the pull request, the
  commit and the author — and the same entry becomes the body of the GitHub
  Release for the tag. The file is included in the npm tarball, so it is also
  readable from an installed copy.

  Up to now those changelogs were generated empty, and the GitHub Releases with
  them, so there was no record of what any given version contained. Releases from
  this one on have one; earlier versions stay blank.

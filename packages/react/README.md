# Val React

This package contains Val React dependent code.

NOTE: do not use this directly, use the package corresponding to your meta-framework (e.g. Next) instead.

## Contributors

Any code that has a dependency on React should be in this package.

There are rules when evaluating modules that skips React specific things, since React (currently 2023-08-15) does not have an ESM build.

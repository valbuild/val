### Minor Changes

- [#589](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/589) [`c2d3c0e`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/c2d3c0e6c2010c0a94c725d9dbaa618998773e8a) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - **Breaking:** `s.richtext()` options are flat.

  The `style`, `block` and `inline` groups are gone — every option is a key of its
  own. The names are unchanged, so updating a schema is only a matter of removing
  the wrappers:

  ```ts
  // before
  s.richtext({
    style: { bold: true, italic: true },
    block: { h1: true, ul: true },
    inline: { a: true, img: s.image() },
  });

  // after
  s.richtext({
    bold: true,
    italic: true,
    h1: true,
    ul: true,
    a: true,
    img: s.image(),
  });
  ```

  The groups never carried any meaning the option names did not already have, and
  they cost something real: an option name and its `ValRichText` theme key were
  spelled differently (`block.h1` vs `theme.h1`), so the type that keeps a theme
  exhaustive had to restate all thirteen options by hand. It is now a mapped type
  over the options themselves — which also fixes an inconsistency in it: enabling
  links with a schema (`a: s.route()`) rather than `a: true` now requires an `a`
  key in the theme, the way `img` always has.

  `ValRichText` themes were already flat and are unchanged. The serialized schema
  that the server sends the Studio is flat too, so a project must not mix
  `@valbuild/*` versions across this release.

### Minor Changes

- [#574](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/574) [`198ba8b`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/198ba8bd8e6c921660e97f5cd26fb17f2d5f3f95) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - The assistant lets you pick which model answers, from the models your key can
  actually reach.

  The content server now asks each provider what a key may use and reports the
  answer; the Studio offers exactly that, beside the composer. Which model to use
  is a per-message decision — something cheap for a typo, something strong for a
  hard question — so the control sits where the message is written rather than in
  a settings panel.

  The choice is remembered per browser and re-checked against what is on offer
  each time the assistant starts, so a model an account has lost access to is
  quietly replaced instead of being sent and refused.

  A content server that does not report models, or could not reach a provider,
  leaves the built-in catalog as the fallback, filtered to reachable providers.

### Minor Changes

- [#582](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/582) [`fca3efa`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/fca3efa389e2817401f55ea3dd184af7c611b807) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Accept OAuth access tokens on the MCP endpoint, so editors can authorize as themselves

  `initValMcp` takes an optional `oauth` config. Give it the authorization server's
  URL and this endpoint's own URL, and every MCP call must then present an access
  token that Val's authorization server issued:

  ```ts
  const { valMcpAuthorize, valMcpTools, valMcpMetadata } = initValMcp(
    valModules,
    config,
    {
      oauth: {
        issuer: "https://admin.val.build",
        resource: "https://your-app.com/api/mcp",
      },
    },
  );
  ```

  The token is verified in your app — signature against the issuer's published
  keys, plus issuer, audience and expiry — so the caller's identity is checked
  rather than claimed. **Patches created over MCP now carry that profile as their
  author**, which is what makes an edit made from a phone show up in the review
  screen as somebody's rather than nobody's. Scopes are enforced too: a token
  without `val:write` cannot reach a tool that writes.

  Mount the discovery document so clients can find where to authorize:

  ```ts
  // app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/route.ts
  import { valMcpMetadata } from "../../../val/mcp";
  export const { GET, OPTIONS } = valMcpMetadata!;
  ```

  `valMcpMetadata` is `null` when no `oauth` config is given.

  **Nothing changes if you leave `oauth` out.** Local development still works with
  no authorization server, and an app already using a personal access token keeps
  working as before.

  One breaking change if you built your own host on `createValTools`:
  `ValToolContext.auth` is now a tagged union, so `{ pat }` becomes
  `{ type: "pat", pat }`. The new variant is
  `{ type: "verified-profile", profileId, scopes }`, for a host that verified a
  token itself.

### Patch Changes

- [#579](https://github.com/valbuild/val/pull/579) [`b2812ae`](https://github.com/valbuild/val/commit/b2812ae4ee03e005ecead3365f49c625e536f94d) Thanks [@freekh](https://github.com/freekh)! - Every release now ships a changelog. Each package's `CHANGELOG.md` records what
  changed under the version that shipped it — with a link to the pull request, the
  commit and the author — and the same entry becomes the body of the GitHub
  Release for the tag. The file is included in the npm tarball, so it is also
  readable from an installed copy.

  Up to now those changelogs were generated empty, and the GitHub Releases with
  them, so there was no record of what any given version contained. Releases from
  this one on have one; earlier versions stay blank.
